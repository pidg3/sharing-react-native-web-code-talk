# React Native for Web

This talk was presented at Edinburgh React meetup in December 2017.

It was filmed, however the link is unfortunately a victim of Slack's 10,000 message limit. 

The overall message was that:
- React Native for Web is a great tool for prototyping.
- However, I didn't feel - based on my experience - that it was production ready.
